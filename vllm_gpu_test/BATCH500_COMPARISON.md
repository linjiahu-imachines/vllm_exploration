## Detailed Results

### Test 1: Transformers on CPU (500 prompts)

The HuggingFace Transformers library runs inference entirely on CPU. The full batch of
500 prompts is tokenized together, then `model.generate()` processes them sequentially
through the model.

**Performance:**

| Metric       | Value              |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Total time   | 31.12s             |
| Per prompt   | 62.24ms            |
| Throughput   | 16.07 prompts/sec  |

**CPU Core Utilization:**

| Metric                          | Value            |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Total logical threads available | 80               |
| Active threads (>5% util)      | **80 out of 80** |
| Average CPU utilization         | 23.9%            |
| Max process threads             | 106              |
| Average process memory          | 2,708 MB         |

**Top 10 Most Utilized Logical Threads:**

| Thread | Utilization |
|--------|-------------|
| 22     | 42.2%       |
| 64     | 41.8%       |
| 74     | 38.7%       |
| 24     | 37.9%       |
| 21     | 37.8%       |
| 61     | 36.2%       |
| 23     | 35.7%       |
| 60     | 35.7%       |
| 16     | 35.4%       |
| 30     | 35.4%       |

**Analysis**: PyTorch utilizes all 80 logical threads, but the average per-thread load
is only 23.9%. The busiest thread reaches 42.2%. This indicates the workload is spread
broadly but is not CPU-compute-bound; it is limited by memory bandwidth and the
sequential nature of autoregressive token generation.

### Test 2: vLLM on CPU (500 prompts)

vLLM v0.15.1 CPU build running on CPU-only (no GPU). The CPU build of vLLM is a
**separate installation** from the GPU build -- it uses a CPU-specific attention backend
and torch linear (with oneDNN fallback) instead of CUDA kernels. vLLM auto-binds
OpenMP threads to 20 physical cores on NUMA node 1 (cores 40-59).

**Important**: vLLM CPU requires a separate `pip install` with CPU-specific wheels.
It does NOT use the same vLLM package as GPU inference.

**Performance:**

| Metric          | Value              |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Init time       | 12.00s             |
| Inference time  | 73.59s             |
| Per prompt      | 147.18ms           |
| Throughput      | 6.79 prompts/sec   |

**CPU Core Utilization (vLLM CPU):**

| Metric                          | Value            |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Total logical threads available | 80               |
| Active threads (>5% util)      | **78 out of 80** |
| Average CPU utilization         | 26.3%            |
| Max process threads             | 189              |
| Average process memory          | 535 MB           |

**Top 10 Most Utilized Logical Threads (vLLM):**

| Thread | Utilization |
|--------|-------------|
| 40     | 90.1%       |
| 48     | 82.6%       |
| 51     | 82.4%       |
| 50     | 82.1%       |
| 49     | 82.1%       |
| 46     | 82.1%       |
| 41     | 82.0%       |
| 54     | 82.0%       |
| 44     | 82.0%       |
| 47     | 81.9%       |

**Analysis**: vLLM CPU shows a very different CPU utilization pattern compared to
Transformers. Its OMP threads are bound to cores 40-59 (NUMA node 1), with those cores
running at 80-90% utilization. The remaining cores show lower utilization from background
processes. Despite higher per-core utilization (82% vs 42% peak), vLLM is **2.4x slower**
than Transformers on CPU. See the dedicated
[Why vLLM is Slower on CPU](#why-vllm-is-slower-than-transformers-on-cpu) section below
for an in-depth analysis.

### Test 3: Transformers on GPU (500 prompts)

HuggingFace Transformers with the model loaded on a single NVIDIA TITAN RTX in FP16.
The batch of 500 prompts is processed in chunks of 50 to avoid GPU memory exhaustion.

**Performance:**

| Metric        | Value              |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Total time    | 2.86s              |
| Per prompt    | 5.72ms             |
| Throughput    | 174.67 prompts/sec |
| Peak GPU mem  | 0.47 GB            |

**Analysis**: Moving to GPU gives a **10.9x speedup** over CPU Transformers. However,
Transformers uses a naive batching approach (padding all inputs to the same length,
processing in fixed chunks) with no KV cache optimization.

---

### Test 4: vLLM on GPU (500 prompts)

vLLM v0.15.1 with the V1 engine on a single NVIDIA TITAN RTX, using FP16 precision,
FlashInfer attention backend, and eager mode (no CUDA graphs). vLLM manages the entire
batch natively with PagedAttention and continuous batching.

**Performance:**

| Metric         | Value              |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Init time      | 12.77s             |
| Inference time | **0.91s**          |
| Per prompt     | **1.82ms**         |
| Throughput     | **550.81 prompts/sec** |
| Peak GPU mem   | **0.01 GB**        |

**Note**: The 12.77s initialization includes model loading, KV cache allocation
(585,200 tokens capacity), and FlashInfer kernel warmup. This is a one-time cost;
subsequent batches would only incur the 0.91s inference time.

**Analysis**: vLLM is **3.1x faster** than Transformers on the same GPU, processing
500 prompts in under 1 second. The throughput of 550.8 prompts/sec (~20,500 output
tokens/sec) demonstrates the efficiency of PagedAttention and continuous batching.
GPU memory usage is dramatically lower (0.01 GB vs 0.47 GB) because vLLM's paged
KV cache is managed separately from PyTorch's CUDA memory allocator.

## Key Findings

### 1. vLLM DOES support CPU inference (with separate CPU build)

Contrary to common belief, vLLM has a dedicated CPU backend. However:

- **Separate installation required**: The CPU build is a different package from the GPU
  build (different wheels, different compilation)
- **Slower than Transformers on CPU**: vLLM's serving infrastructure overhead doesn't
  pay off without GPU acceleration; Transformers is **2.4x faster** on CPU
- **Uses fewer cores by default**: vLLM auto-binds OMP threads to one NUMA node (20 cores),
  while Transformers uses all 80 logical threads

### 2. vLLM is 3.1x faster than Transformers on GPU at batch 500

At batch size 500, vLLM processes the entire batch in 0.91 seconds compared to
2.86 seconds for Transformers. This advantage comes from:

- **PagedAttention**: Efficient, non-contiguous KV cache management avoids memory
  fragmentation and waste
- **Continuous batching**: Dynamically schedules requests as they complete rather
  than waiting for the entire batch
- **Optimized CUDA kernels**: FlashInfer attention kernels are tuned for inference

### 3. GPU gives 10.9-34.2x speedup over CPU

| Path                               | Speedup over CPU Transformers |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Transformers: CPU → GPU            | 10.9x                         |
| Best path: CPU → vLLM GPU          | 34.2x                         |
| vLLM: CPU → GPU                    | 80.9x                         |

### 4. CPU utilization patterns differ significantly

| Metric              | Transformers CPU    | vLLM CPU              |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Active threads      | 80/80               | 78/80                 |
| OMP threads used    | 80 (all)            | 20 (NUMA node 1)     |
| Peak per-core util  | 42.2%               | 90.1%                 |
| Avg CPU util        | 23.9%               | 26.3%                 |
| Process memory      | 2,708 MB            | 535 MB                |
| Throughput          | 16.07 p/s           | 6.79 p/s              |

**Insight**: vLLM focuses computation on fewer cores with higher utilization, while
Transformers spreads work across all cores at lower utilization. For CPU inference,
the "spread wide" approach (Transformers) outperforms the "focused" approach (vLLM).

### 5. vLLM uses 98% less GPU memory

| Engine       | Peak GPU Memory | KV Cache Strategy  |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Transformers | 0.47 GB         | Contiguous tensors |
| vLLM         | 0.01 GB         | PagedAttention     |

vLLM's paged memory management is dramatically more efficient, which is critical for
serving larger models or higher concurrency.

## Why vLLM is Slower Than Transformers on CPU

vLLM on CPU (73.59s) is **2.4x slower** than plain Transformers on CPU (31.12s) for the
same 500-prompt workload. This is a counterintuitive result -- vLLM is designed to
accelerate inference -- so it warrants a detailed explanation.

### 1. Multi-Process Architecture Overhead

vLLM was designed as a high-concurrency **serving engine**, not a simple inference
library. Even for a batch call via `LLM.generate()`, it spawns a full serving stack:

```
Transformers (direct path):
  Python script → model.generate() → PyTorch ops → result
  Overhead: minimal

vLLM (serving path):
  Python script → LLM() → spawn EngineCore process → Scheduler
    → RequestManager → BatchQueue → CPU Worker → OMP threads
    → KV Cache Manager → PagedAttention → result → IPC back
  Overhead: significant
```

The `EngineCore` runs in a **separate process** (visible as `EngineCore_DP0` in logs),
communicating with the main process via inter-process communication (IPC). This
multi-process design is essential for GPU serving (where the GPU worker must not be
blocked by Python's GIL), but on CPU it adds latency for every batch of tokens without
any corresponding benefit.

**Measured impact**: vLLM's init time alone is 12.00 seconds (engine core startup,
scheduler initialization, KV cache allocation). Transformers has zero initialization
overhead beyond model loading.

### 2. NUMA-Aware Thread Binding (20 vs 80 threads)

This is likely the **single largest factor** in the performance gap.

vLLM's CPU backend is NUMA-aware and auto-binds OpenMP threads to physical cores on
**one NUMA node** to optimize memory locality:

```
vLLM:         20 OMP threads → cores 40-59 (NUMA node 1 only)
Transformers: 80 threads     → all cores across both NUMA nodes
```

The machine has 2 NUMA nodes with 20 physical cores each (40 total, 80 with
Hyper-Threading). By binding to only one node, vLLM uses **half the available compute**
but gains memory locality (all memory accesses hit local DRAM).

For this small model (125M parameters), memory locality matters less than raw
parallelism. Transformers' "use everything" approach wins because:
- The model fits entirely in L3 cache across both nodes
- The workload is embarrassingly parallel across prompts
- Cross-NUMA memory penalties are small for this model size

For larger models (7B+) that exceed a single NUMA node's memory, vLLM's NUMA-aware
binding would be more advantageous.

### 3. oneDNN Linear Layer Fallback

The CPU build of vLLM attempts to use Intel's **oneDNN** library for optimized matrix
multiplication. On this system, oneDNN failed:

```
WARNING: Failed to create oneDNN linear, fallback to torch linear.
Exception: could not create a primitive descriptor for the matmul primitive.
```

This happens because the model uses **float16** (the default dtype for OPT-125M),
but this CPU (Intel Xeon Gold 6242R, Cascade Lake) lacks the `avx512_bf16` instruction.
oneDNN's optimized float16 matmul requires either BF16 hardware support or specific
instruction combinations not available here.

As a result, vLLM falls back to **generic torch linear**, which is the same code path
Transformers uses -- but vLLM pays for the overhead of attempting oneDNN first and its
multi-process architecture on top.

**Potential fix**: Using `dtype="float32"` or running on a CPU with `avx512_bf16`
support (Intel Ice Lake/Sapphire Rapids or AMD Zen 4+) would allow oneDNN to use its
optimized kernels.

### 4. Serving-Oriented Scheduling

vLLM's scheduler is designed for **continuous batching** in an online serving scenario
where requests arrive and complete at different times. This scheduler:

- Maintains a priority queue of pending requests
- Allocates and manages KV cache blocks per-request
- Tracks token budgets and prefill/decode phases
- Handles chunked prefill (splitting long prompts into chunks)

For a simple offline batch of 500 identical-length prompts, this scheduling complexity
adds overhead without benefit. Transformers simply tokenizes and runs `model.generate()`
in a tight loop with no scheduling layer.

### 5. KV Cache Management on CPU

vLLM uses **PagedAttention** to manage the KV cache even on CPU. While this is
memory-efficient (535 MB vs 2,708 MB for Transformers), it introduces:

- **Block table indirection**: Each attention operation must look up physical block
  addresses through a block table, adding pointer-chasing overhead on CPU
- **Non-contiguous memory access**: Paged blocks are not contiguous in memory, reducing
  cache line efficiency on CPU (on GPU, this is hidden by massive memory bandwidth)
- **Block allocation/deallocation**: The block manager must track, allocate, and free
  blocks as sequences grow, adding per-token overhead

On GPU, PagedAttention's memory savings enable serving many more concurrent requests
(the primary goal). On CPU, the memory savings are less valuable because system RAM
is abundant (251 GB available), and the indirection overhead hurts more because CPU
memory bandwidth is the bottleneck.

### 6. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Every batch of generated tokens must be communicated between the `EngineCore` worker
process and the main process. This IPC involves:

- Serializing tensor data
- Copying across process boundaries (shared memory or pipes)
- Deserializing on the receiving end
- Synchronization barriers

On GPU, this overhead is negligible compared to GPU kernel execution time. On CPU,
where inference itself is slower, IPC becomes a meaningful fraction of total time.

### Summary: When Does vLLM CPU Make Sense?

| Factor | Favors Transformers | Favors vLLM CPU |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| Small model (<1B params) | ✓ Less overhead matters more | |
| Large model (>7B params) | | ✓ PagedAttention memory savings critical |
| Batch/offline processing | ✓ No scheduling overhead | |
| Online serving (many users) | | ✓ Continuous batching, request management |
| Single NUMA node system | Roughly equal | Roughly equal |
| Multi-NUMA system | ✓ Uses all cores | ✓ Better memory locality per node |
| CPU with AVX-512 BF16 | | ✓ oneDNN optimized kernels enabled |
| API compatibility with GPU prod | | ✓ Same vLLM API, easy migration |

**Bottom line**: For offline batch inference of small models on CPU, Transformers is
the clear winner (2.4x faster, simpler setup). vLLM CPU is better suited for **online
serving** scenarios where its continuous batching, request management, and API
compatibility with GPU deployments justify the overhead.

## Scaling Comparison: Batch 5 vs Batch 500

Using data from the original (batch 5) and current (batch 500) tests:

| Scenario            | Batch 5  | Batch 500 | Time Scaling (100x batch) |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Transformers CPU    | 0.87s    | 31.12s    | 35.8x (sublinear)         |
| vLLM CPU            | 9.70s*   | 73.59s    | 7.6x (sublinear)          |
| Transformers GPU    | 0.27s    | 2.86s     | 10.6x (sublinear)         |
| vLLM GPU            | 0.18s    | 0.91s     | **5.1x (highly sublinear)** |

*vLLM CPU batch-5 time from previous experiment (different vLLM version may have been used).

| Scenario                           | Batch 5 Speedup (vLLM vs Trans GPU) | Batch 500 Speedup |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| vLLM vs Transformers GPU           | 1.5x                                 | **3.1x**           |

**Key Insight**: vLLM's advantage **increases with batch size**. At batch 5, vLLM
was only 1.5x faster on GPU. At batch 500, it is 3.1x faster. This is because vLLM's
continuous batching and PagedAttention optimizations have higher payoff with larger
workloads. For production serving with concurrent requests, vLLM's advantage would
be even greater.

## Recommendations

| Scenario                     | Recommended Engine |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
| CPU-only deployment          | **HuggingFace Transformers** (2.4x faster than vLLM on CPU) |
| Single GPU, low traffic      | Either (Transformers is simpler to set up) |
| Single GPU, high throughput  | **vLLM** (3.1x faster at batch 500) |
| Multi-GPU production serving | **vLLM** (PagedAttention + tensor parallelism) |
| Latency-critical (per query) | **vLLM GPU** (1.82ms vs 5.72ms per prompt) |
| Memory-constrained GPU       | **vLLM** (98% less GPU memory) |

## How to Reproduce

```bash
cd /home/linhu/projects/vllm_exploration/vllm_gpu_test

# Activate GPU virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install CPU monitoring dependency
pip install psutil

# Run the complete 4-way comparison
VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=TRITON_ATTN python3 test_batch500_complete.py

# Results are printed to console and saved to batch500_results.json
```

**Notes**:
- `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=TRITON_ATTN` is required because the TITAN RTX
  (compute capability 7.5) does not support FlashAttention-2. On newer GPUs
  (A100, H100), this is not needed.
- Test 2 (vLLM CPU) runs as a subprocess using the CPU-specific vLLM build
  from `vllm_test/venv/`. This separate venv is required because vLLM CPU
  and GPU are different packages.
- The CPU test uses `max_num_seqs=5` and default auto-configuration (no
  manual thread binding) for stability.
